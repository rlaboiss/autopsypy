# Automating PsychoPy experiments in Builder

## Introduction

When building inter-participant experiments with PsychoPy's GUI Builder, two issues may arise:

1. The need for adapting the stimuli to different conditions, according to the group to which the participant is assigned.
2. Automatically assigning participants to the experimental conditions, such that the amount of participants across the groups is balanced.

These issues can be addressed by adding extensive Python code to Code block available in the Builder. The goal of the `autopsypy` is to simplify this task, requiring an extremely low amount of Python code to be added to the experiment.

## How it works

### An example

Let us illustrate how the module works through a very simple example. Imagine that we wish to investigate the participant's preference between two images, say a daisy and a pine. We will present both images simultaneously on the screen during 10 seconds and determine the fixation time on each image using, for instance, oculometric measurements. In order to avoid left/right preferences, we divide the participants into two groups. The daisy will be on the left side and the pine will be on the right side for the first group and vice-versa for the second group, as illustrated below:

In PsychoPy's Builder, this is how a minimalist experiment would be set up, with two Image components and one Code component:

### Specifying the conditions

The Code component, which can be placed in any routine of the experiment,
must contain, in its section “Before Experiment”, the following code:

```python
from autopsypy import AutoPsyPy
x = AutoPsyPy()
```

This will create a variable `x` of class `AutoPsyPy`. Any name can be used for the variable, `x` being simply an example here. The autopsypy module will then open the comma-separated value (CSV) file `conditions.csv` that must exist in the current directory. Any other file name can be used through the argument `conditions` of `AutoPsyPy()`. The field delimiter of the CSV file can be specified by the 
`csv_delimiter` argument and defaults to the semicolon `";"`.

The conditions file must contain the names of the columns (that will be used later, see below) and each subsequent line will represent a experimental condition. In our example, the conditions file will look like this:

```
left;right
daisy.jpg;pine.png
pine.png;daisy.jpg
```

The names of the columns will be used in the settings of the Image blocks, more precisely in the files “Image”. It must be set to `$x["left"]` in the component labeled “left” and `$x["right"]` in the component labeled “right”.

### Specifying the groups

The groups are defined by introducing variables in the “Experiment info” section of the Properties window (accessible by clicking on the gear icon). The `autopsypy` module needs the presence of a “participant” field (with that precise name). A field with name “condition” is forbidden (the experiment will stop with an error message in this case). Any other field created will be used in the definitions of the groups.

Let us say that a field with name “age” was created in the Experiment info section and that participants would be either in the “young” group or in the “old” group, an information that will be provided when the experiment is started.

At the first time the experiment is run, a CSV file `sessions.csv` will be created (or whichever name is specified through the `sessions` argument of `AutoPsyPy()`). This file will have always columns named `participant`, `datetime`, and `condition`. In our present example, a forth column will be added, with name `age`. If the sessions file already exists, it will be used by `autopsypy` module and is not recreated. This file will keep a record of which condition was selected for each participant. It can be edited at will between two consecutive sessions, for example for getting rid of a falling participant.

The `condition` column contains integers that indicate the select line in the conditions file. In our case, the value will be either 1 or 2 (for the daisy on the left side or on the right side, respectively). Let us say that, three participants have already run the experiment, two “young” and one “old.” The sessions file will look like the following:

```
participant;datetime;age;condition
1;2023-09-05_10h53.01.058;young;1
2;2023-09-06_12h33.38.161;old;1
3;2023-09-06_16h56.26.312;young;2
```

If the fourth participant is “young”, then condition 1 will be run. otherwise, if the fourth participant is “old”, then condition 2 will be run.

Extra fields can added to the Experiment info section and will contribute to the stratification of participants. For instance, if a new field “gender” is created with two values “male” and “female”, then `autopsypy` will consider that four groups exist (“young female”, “old female”, “young male”, and “old male”) and will balance the number of conditions 1 and 2 in each group.

At the end of the experiment, the chosen condition is shown to the user.
